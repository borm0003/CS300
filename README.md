# 🏰 Course Search and Sort Quest 🏰
**1. Project One File: _Runtime Analysis.pdf_**
  - **Purpose:** Provides an in-depth runtime and memory analysis for three data structures: vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees (BST).
    - Key Takeaways:
      - **Vectors:** Simple and efficient for smaller datasets but slow for searching. If you're in a hurry, this isn't the questing buddy you want on your team.
      - **Hash Tables:** Lightning-fast searches but could be better with sorting. A certain superhero in a flashy red suit comes to mind.
      - **BSTs:** Efficient with insertion and search and sorting occurs naturally with how this structure behaves when placing data organically, making it the best choice for this project.

**2. Project Two File: _ProjectTwo_Bormann_Krysta.cpp_**
- **Purpose:** Implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) structured code system to load, sort, and print a list of courses along with the course information.
    - Key Features:
      - Loads course data from a CSV file and parses it.
      - Prints all courses in sorted alphanumeric order by course number.
      - Searches for courses by number and displays prerequisites, if any, are required.
     
# 🌟 **Reflection: A Quest Worth Taking** 🌟

**What was the problem?**  

The primary objective of this mission was to design a course-planning system that could load a CSV data file into a data structure, print the courses in alphanumeric order, and search for a specific course then subsequently display its title and prerequisites. It was like crafting a leveling and strategy guide 📖 for students.  

**How Did I Approach the Problem?**

Like any good gamer, I selected the best "gear" (data structure). After analyzing the pros and cons of vectors, hash tables, and BSTs, I chose BST because it handles sorted traversal and has a fast search return. It was not because it was easy to implement, that is for sure. From there, I broke the project into mini-quests to make the final "boss fight" of compiling the final product much more manageable.  

**Roadblocks and How I Overcame Them**  

**1. Infinite Loop Gremlins 🌀:**
-  Several times throughout the process I fell into the pool of infinite loops when invalid entries, non-numeric inputs, case-sensitive entries, or missing validation code managed to catch me by surprise.
-  I was able to implement input validation throughout the code and escape the horror of infinite looping.
