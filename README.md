1. **Project One File**: Runtime Analysis.pdf
  - Purpose: Provides an in-depth runtime and memory analysis for three data structures: vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees (BST).
    - Key Takeaways:
      - **Vectors:** Simple and efficient for smaller datasets but slow for searching. If you're in a hurry, this isn't the questing buddy you want on your team.
      - **Hash Tables:** Lightning-fast searches but could be better with sorting. A certain superhero in a flashy red suit comes to mind.
      - **BSTs:** Efficient with insertion and search and sorting occurs naturally with how this structure behaves when placing data organically, making it the best choice for this project.
